Overview:
This file defines the `User` data model using SQLAlchemy, a Python library that facilitates Object-Relational Mapping (ORM). ORM allows developers to work with databases using native Python objects instead of writing SQL queries directly. This abstraction enables developers to interact with the database in a more intuitive and object-oriented way.

Relational Database:
A relational database organizes data into one or more tables where data types may be related to each other; these relations help structure the data. SQL (Structured Query Language) is typically used to manage and query data in these databases.

SQLAlchemy:
SQLAlchemy is one of the most feature-rich ORM libraries available in Python. It offers a full suite of tools to handle database interactions, including a powerful ORM layer and a schema migration utility called Alembic. SQLAlchemy ORM allows developers to define Python classes as mappings to database tables, and instances of those classes as rows in those tables.

Alembic:
Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for use with SQLAlchemy. It tracks database schema changes and applies them incrementally to the database. It is essential for evolving the database schema safely and efficiently without losing data.

Enums in Python:
An Enum (Enumerated type) is a symbolic name for a set of values. Enums help to code clarity by preventing the use of magic numbers and providing validation of acceptable values. Pythonâ€™s `enum` module defines an enumeration type with iteration and comparison capabilities.

SQLAlchemy Enum:
SQLAlchemy supports Python's native enumeration types to be used in database columns. This feature allows enums to be stored in the database as string or integer values while being used in the code as enum instances, which adds a layer of validation and ease of use in the application code.

Mapped:
SQLAlchemy's `Mapped` type is a hint to type checkers that a class attribute is expected to be mapped to a database column. This helps with IDEs and tools to understand the types without the actual database interaction.

Attributes Explained:
Each attribute in the `User` class represents a column in the database with specific characteristics like data type, constraints, and defaults. Attributes such as `id`, `username`, `email`, etc., are defined with their respective SQL types and constraints such as uniqueness or indexability.
