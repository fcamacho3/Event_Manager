## Reflective Summary

Working on the Event Manager project provided a profound opportunity to enhance both my technical skills and collaborative processes. One of the key technical skills I developed was containerization using Docker. Setting up the Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml for the project improved my understanding of how to create reproducible development environments, manage dependencies, and ensure consistency across different development setups. Additionally, I gained valuable experience with FastAPI, learning how to structure a scalable web application, implement CRUD operations, and integrate with a PostgreSQL database. The process of writing and running tests using pytest and httpx emphasized the importance of automated testing in maintaining code quality and reliability.

Collaboratively, the project underscored the importance of clear communication and effective use of version control systems like GitHub. Coordinating with team members through pull requests and issues, I realized the critical role of detailed commit messages and thorough code reviews in maintaining project integrity. One of the significant challenges was ensuring that all team members were aligned on the projectâ€™s goals and code standards, which we addressed through regular meetings and detailed documentation. This experience taught me the value of combining individual initiative with collaborative effort, highlighting that successful software development is as much about people and processes as it is about code.

Overall, this assignment was instrumental in solidifying my technical and collaborative skills. The hands-on experience with Docker, FastAPI, and automated testing equipped me with practical skills directly applicable to real-world projects. The collaborative aspect reinforced the need for clear communication, detailed documentation, and effective use of version control systems. These insights will undoubtedly influence how I approach future projects, both technically and collaboratively.
